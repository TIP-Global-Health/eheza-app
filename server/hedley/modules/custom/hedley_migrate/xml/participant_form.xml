            Prenatal and Post Partum Participant Grievance Procedure

            <p>
                TIP believes in giving participants second chances and in
                making changes to our program to better serve our participants.
                The Ihangane Project is dedicated to providing the highest
                quality of services to our participants. We believe that to
                accomplish this, we must provide them with a method of
                addressing issues and/or concerns that cannot be resolved
                informally between TIP participants and staff.
            </p>

            <h2>What is a Grievance?</h2>

            <p>
                A grievance is a formal expression of concern about any
                particular issue thought to be unjust, unfair or abusive.
                Filing a grievance means putting in writing anything that
                you have experienced that you believe was harmful or unfair.
                You have the right to file a grievance at any time without
                fear of retaliation.
            </p>

            <h2>Formal Grievance Procedures</h2>

            <p>
                <b>Step 1.</b> If for any reason a TIP participant feels
                she/he has not been treated well or fairly or has not received
                the service expected, that participant can address their grievance
                in writing to the Community Health Worker responsible for their case.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Step 2.</b> Should the participant not receive complete
                satisfaction after addressing the staff person directly,
                or if they feel uncomfortable addressing that person,
                the client is encouraged to address the Hospital Director
                with their written complaint.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Step 3.</b> Following this course, should no satisfaction be
                attained with the Hospital Director, the participant may contact
                the US-based team via email or by phone.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Step 4.</b> The participant can expect their grievance to be
                addressed and resolved in a under one month
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Step 5.</b> Upon final resolution of the grievance issue,
                the appropriate TIP staff will propose a summary of the issue,
                ultimate resolution, and the action plan to prevent repeat occurrences.
            </p>
