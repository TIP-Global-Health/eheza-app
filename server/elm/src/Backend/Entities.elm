module Backend.Entities exposing (EntityId(..), fromEntityId, toEntityId)

{-| -}


{-| This is a wrapper for an `Int` id. It takes a "phantom" type variable
in order to gain type-safety about what kind of entity it is an ID for.
So, to specify that you have an id for a clinic, you would say:

    type ClinicId
        = ClinicId

    clinidId : EntityId ClinicId

-}
type EntityId a
    = EntityId Int


{-| This is how you create an `EntityId`, if you have an `Int`. You can create
any kind of `EntityId` this way ... so you would normally only do this in
situations that are fundamentally untyped, such as when you are decoding
JSON data. Except in those kind of "boundary" situations, you should be
working with the typed `EntityIds`.
-}
toEntityId : Int -> EntityId a
toEntityId =
    EntityId


{-| This is how you get an `Int` back from a `EntityId`. You should only use
this in boundary situations, where you need to send the id out in an untyped
way. Normally, you should just pass around the `EntityId` itself, to retain
type-safety.

fromEntityId : EntityId a -> Int
fromEntityId (EntityId a) =
    a
