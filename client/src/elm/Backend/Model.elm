module Backend.Model exposing (..)

{-| The `Backend` hierarchy is for code that represents entities from the
backend. It is reponsible for fetching them, saving them, etc.

  - There shouldn't be any UI code here (except possibly some UI that
    is specifically related to fetching and saving -- we'll see).

  - There shouldn't be data here that purely relates to the local state of the
    app. If it isn't persisted to the backend, that state can go elsewhere.

The nice thing about this is that we can segregate local state (like whether
a dialog box is open etc.) from the state that persists to the backend.
That way, we can more easily have a single source of truth for the
backend data -- we're not tempted to duplicate it in various places
in the UI.

{-| This will eventually define the data we get from the backend.
