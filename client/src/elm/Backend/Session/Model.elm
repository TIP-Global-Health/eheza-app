{-| A "session" refers to a group session with mothers and babies ... that is,
an occasion on which measurements are taken in a group setting.

The `Session` contains basic data for a session.

The `OfflineSession` and `EditableSession` are constructed (on the fly) from
more basic information we track in `Backend.Model`. Eventually, we could
consider getting rid of the middle-man, but it's convenient for the moment
because there was so much code written in terms of an `EditableSession`.

{-| This is the basic `Session` data ... essentially, for scheduling purposes.

The `training` field identifies a "training" session that is handled differently
if we're in the sandbox environment. It is intended to be a kind of session that
can be quickly created and destroyed. (As opposed to historical sessions which
are meant to stay throughout a training workshop).

{-| We index in several ways.

Ideally this would be an opaque type in a separate module, so we can enforce
invariants (e.g. that when we add something to one list, we modify the others
appropriately). However, we only create this in one place, so it would be
overkill for now.

downloading a session for "offline" use. Now, we populate this on the fly

`EditableSession`.
