-- GENERAL CASE


{-| A base that expresses some things all the measurements
have in common, plus two things whose type varies:

  - the type if the ID for the participant
  - the type of the value for this measurement

-}
type alias Measurement value =

    , nurse : Maybe NurseId
    , participantId : PersonId

{-| The string represents the URL of the photo -- that is, the URL which
we can reference in order to display the photo.

distinguish them, and make the units explicit.

{-| An interpretation of a MUAC, according to the measurement
tool referenced at <https://github.com/Gizra/ihangane/issues/282>

-- UNIFIED MEASUREMENT TYPE


{-| A type which handles any kind of measurement along with its ID.
(Thus, it is a "saved" measurement that has been assigned an ID.)

{-| We'll sort these by the date measured, with the most recent first, since
we're particularly interested in the most recent one, and it is faster to
access if it is first.

What type the inner types ought to be is an interesting question ... I'll start
simple with a `List` and see how that goes.

-- ONE OF EACH KIND OF MEASUREMENT

of each kind of measurements (rather than a list of each kind).

a particular session.

{-| Like `ChildMeasurements`, but for mothers.

Note that for `consent`, we could have multiple consents in the same session.
So, it is a `List` (possibly empty) rather than a `Maybe`.

{-| This a convenience for functions which want to take values wrapped
in the given way.

  - `update` indicates whether we're currently saving the edits, or any error
    from the last save.

  - `previous` is the most recently value that is not part of this editing
    session ... that is, a previous value to compare to

  - `current` is the value we've saved.
