module Pages.Activities.Model exposing (..)

import Pages.Page exposing (Page)


{-| This module manages the state for the first part of the UI
flow described in `Pages.Activity.Model`. That is, it shows a list of
activities, and allows the user to click on an activity to see participants
related to that activity.

Note that we don't actually model the `selectedActivity` here, at least for now
... instead, at least for the moment, that is modeled as part of the
`UserAttention` (or `Page`). That might be worth changing at some point, or
perhaps not -- it's not absolutely clear what is best modeled in the `Page`
type itself vs. more specific types.

Also note that we don't manage the `Page.Activity.Model` here (again, at least
for the moment). Instead, we redirect the `Page` in such as way as to show the
desired activity. So, we're not drawing a wrapper around the `Page.Activity`
... we're merely selecting & redirecting.

{-| This is related to the `Tab` type in `Pages.Activity.Model`, except that here
it controls which activities we see (those which are entirely completed or those
with at least one participant pending), whereas there it controls which activities
we see for a particular participant.
