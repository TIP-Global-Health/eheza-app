{-| The strategy here, at least for now, is this:

  - The values in the `Model` here reflect what is entered in the UI. So, they
    are updated on every key-press etc.

  - The `update` function takes a parameter which represents the actual data.
    It updates that parameter only when the value has actually been saved.

So, basically we're doing pure UI here ... all other concerns are handled via
the `OutMsg` returned to the caller, which the caller is expected to do something
useful with.

This means that we need to be able to initialize our UI state here from some
backend state in order to perform an edit -- it's the caller's job to handle
that.

Ideally, we'll eventually use `Restful.RestfulData` to track underlying
data, UI edits, validation, and update status all in one type. If we had that,
we'd wouldn't really need our own model here (and we'd avoid some synchronization
issues) since the data itself would encapsulate an editor state.
