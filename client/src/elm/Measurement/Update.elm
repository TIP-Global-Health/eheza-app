{-| The strategy used here, for the moment, is that the `model` tracks the UI,
(so, for instance, strings instead of floats, and changing on every kepress),
whereas the `editableMeasurements` tracks the underlying data. The only thing
which we can change **directly** here is our own model. If we want to change
the "real" data, we have to return an `OutMsg` to be processed elsehwere (for
instance, by actually writing the data to local storage).
