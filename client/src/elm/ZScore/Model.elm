{-| For now, just make ZScore an alias for a Float ... we could do fancier
things here, if it seems helpful. For instance, we could have phantom
types differentiating between weight-for-length, weight-for-age, etc. But that
seems like it might be overkill.

{- We might want to re-use some of these types generally. In fact, there would
   be ways to be more sophisticated about measurement units, but they might be
   overkill.

   The types are mainly to avoid any confusion about what the units are. It
   forces the caller to do things like:

       zScoreFromHeight (AgeDay 27) Male (Length 27)

   ... so that the caller has to think about what units are being provided.
