module Activity.Utils exposing (..)

{-| Various utilities that deal with "activities". An activity represents the
need for a nurse to do something with respect to a person who is checked in.

Just as a matter of terminology, we use "completed" to mean the obvious thing
-- that is, the action has been performed. The word "pending" is not precisely
the opposite of "completed", because the action is only "pending" if it is
expected (and not completed).
